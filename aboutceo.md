This is Phoebe. The CEO and lead decision maker of the Feemagie content bringing more than five weeks experience of being alive. Previously, Phoebe was learning to walk and figuring out how to bark. Today, she's a become one of the most efficient leads in marketing and project management. During her many nap sessions, you can see her physically twitching dreaming up the next genius decisions for the Feemagie service.

During Phoebe's five weeks of life experiences, she learned to fetch objects and return them to the point of where they were thrown. She attribute this to her uncanny ability to understand, first-hand, the cost and complexity of building on-premise analysis and reporting solutions. A true prodigy of her time.
