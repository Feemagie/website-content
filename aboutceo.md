This is Phoebe: the CEO and lead decision maker of the Feemagie content. Phoebe brings more than five weeks experience of being alive. Previously, Phoebe was learning to walk and figuring out how to bark. Today, she's a become one of the most efficient leads in marketing and project management. During her many nap sessions, you can see her physically twitching and dreaming up the next genius decisions for the Feemagie service.

During Phoebe's five weeks of life experiences, she learned to fetch objects and return them to the same point they were thrown. She attributes this to her uncanny ability to understand, first-hand, the cost and complexity of building on-premise analysis and reporting solutions. A true prodigy of her time.
