Hello there. I'm Feemagie; a name which translates to "Fairy Magic" in the German language. Welcome to my Website!

I am a streamer, writer, and content producer with a degree in Illustrations and Game Design. I enjoy all sorts of games – but most of all, I enjoy the capability games have given us to sharing our *magical* worlds with each other. 

For many, video games have grown with us. Gaming, both literally and figuratively, has refined its resolution and complexity to mind-blowing proportions. Along with it, the availability of amazing tool and resources have allowed anyone to bring their own imaginations to life. You do not have to be a huge corporation with financial backup to create a game anymore. Websites like Kickstarter and Patreon help inspire and support games. All that is needed is an *idea*, *turing machine*, a bit of *skill*/*willpower*, and a *dark corner* where one can find peace….jokes aside, I find the little limitations amazing!

On this site, you can read my experience on this journey, the indie games I enjoy, and my art sessions. While you can watch my streams on [Twitch.TV](https://www.twitch.tv/feemagie) and on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCMUeXZV1ErWasw2qEG8TfA). The posts will go more into detail on each piece.

My priority in my streams is to spread laughs, love, and the **magic of indie gaming**! ❤ whilst interacting with my wonderful community! You can expect relaxed content with a loving, fun and a slightly disturbed community, always feel free to drop by =).
