Blue Fire was released on February 4th 2021, making it a relatively new indie title at the time I wrote this article. It's feels apparent that the game is a mixture of concepts. It takes some from Legend of Zelda's aesthetics, Dark Souls' mechanics, and elements of Hollow Knight. Together, it makes Blue Fire… Sort of? In no way did the game steal from those titles, but rather incorporated qualities from them in its own unique way. If you haven’t tried playing Blue Fire before and you’re a fan of both a challenge and 3D platformers, you’re certainly missing out. The game’s controls can take some time to get use to, but Blue Fire definitely has its high moments. It absolutely stands as a solid indie game (in my humble opinion). For those who love indie games as much as I do, Blue Fire is truly a can’t-miss — it’s a great fun title for your buck.

# Blue Fire and ROBI Studios

Technically, Blue Fire is categorized as an adventure, platformer, action, and role-playing game — but let me tell you, it’s SO much more than that. Blue Fire’s developers at ROBI Studios, is a very young company located in Argentina. Blue Fire being their first title known to be released.
“We're a young and very passionate team in growth dedicated to indie game development (PC and Consoles) and high quality art.” - ROBI Studios Team
The developers seem to have a knack for artistic design in their indie titles. The game has vast, stunning worlds to explore, 3D platforming, exciting puzzles/challenges, quests, action, combat, and everything in between. Plus, you get to run on walls and smack bad guys with your two swords. Not to mention that your character is ADORABLE —  it doesn’t get any better than that!

# Who It’s For

If you're anything like me, you’re probably going to die a lot playing this game. Similar to dark souls, you can easily lose your collection of “ore”, the game currency, which helps your character gain in resources and abilities. Play this game if...

* You’re a fan of platformers
* You don’t get frustrated easily (or have no people around to stangle)
* You crave the feeling of completing a task after many tries
* You enjoy unique characters with adorable designs
* You love exploring interesting and rewarding worlds
* You’re a big fan of adventure/role playing games like Breath of the Wild
* You have a passion for puzzle games
* No loose objects around to throw savagely

...or any combination of the above, then you’re almost certain to love Blue Fire. For me, this game checks a lot of boxes and is very accessible. That’s part of the reason why it’s one of my go-to indie games for my stream.

# Platforms

This platformer, though I mostly play it on the Switch, is available on most platforms (get it?). Whether you are part of the PC master race, a Switch fanatic, or prefer to spend your time on the PS4, you’ll be able to pick up Blue Fire for only $20 or less.
