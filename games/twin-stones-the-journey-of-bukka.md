Twin Stones: The Journey of Bukka by Oasis Balloon Studio tells the story of a hunter boy casually out tracking for food and stumbles upon a magical flying being named Shiva that asks him to kill God. Bukka obliges to the reasonless demands of Shiva. Shiva, you find out, is a God herself so there isn't much choice but her follow her words. She promises to explain later but ends up threatening you more with demonstrations of destructive abilities. Bukka leaves all behind to slaughter all in his path to fulfill his given destiny. I love it!
