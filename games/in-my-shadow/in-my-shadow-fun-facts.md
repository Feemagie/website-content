There are some hidden secrets and special interactions after achieving some circumstances that can be found within some indie games. In My Shadow is one of those that took the extra effort to put these in. I know a few, and I'm wanting to share what I know!
 
## Times the Dog Shadow won't Disappear
 
If you played some of the first levels of the game, you might have noticed the dog will sometimes vanish after reaching it; consequently leaving a sad little girl. But you might also notice there are times the dog will stay to the end of the level's scene! This isn't a random occurrence.

**To ensure the shadowy character doesn't leave a sad girl behind, you must beat the level without dying!**

This was demonstrated in a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/l4nn72/wanted_to_reward_the_skillful_play_and_wanted_the/) by PlayBae back in January 25, 2021 before the game's release.

## It's not a PC Game, for real!?

Although not a fact within the game, did you know the game is actually intended for touchscreen devices: specifically for the Switch and/or Android phones. The game was more or less ported to the PC, and still had great responses to that audience too!

The mobile version is still on it's way and you can check out the updates for it on the [official In My Shadow discord](https://inmyshadow.com/discord).

## An Overdo Text Message

Once you finish the game's extra level, you'll notice the woman uses her phone one more time to text her father. But what did she write? Well, did you know you're able check it out later on her phone! And yes, I'm giving you the okay to take a peek at this girls messages just once. However, to know what the message said, you'll have to play it yourself ;)

### That's all in the Shadow for Now

There can certainly be more than meets the Feemagie eye. Do you know some facts? Let me know in the comments below, make a pull request on GitHub, or send me a tweet: @feemagie.
