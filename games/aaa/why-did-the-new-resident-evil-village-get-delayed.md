As if the coronavirus didn’t put a damper on enough aspects of our lives, it is now likely going to affect the release date of the newest Resident Evil game, Resident Evil Village, that was supposed to release on May 7th. And while Capcom still has the release date listed as May 7th, the latest issue of Edge magazine has stated that it has been pushed back to June 22nd. And while many of us Twitch gamers are hoping that this may be a typo, it, unfortunately, sounds pretty legit.

While the reason for this is unknown, June 22nd is the first proper Summer Game Festival stream that is presented by the Game Awards, which seems like a good time to release the game. With that being said, take this information with a grain of salt and stay up-to-date with Capcom’s announcements to stay in-the-know about a true release date.

### Resident Evil Village: What We Know So Far

Resident Evil Village, the “eighth” Resident Evil game to date, is a survival horror game that is looking to be one of the most spectacular versions that will support multiple upgrades, provide faster loading times, provide 3D audio (making it THAT much creepier), have improved time frames, and have hyper-detailed graphics… sounds like this might just be the closest PS5/Xbox game to VR!

RE Village is going to be set a few years after RE 7 with Ethan Winters returning as the protagonist of the game. You’ll start off the game by making your way from the Village to the castle, where you will need to look for your kidnapped daughter. You’ll notice right away just how much time and effort the team at Capcom put into making this game feel as real and authentic as possible, with such an intricate amount of detail and a tremendous amount of stunning visuals.

You’ll pretty quickly meet some of the castle denizens as you make your way through the castle, who, as you would expect, do not provide you with the warmest welcome. As you continue to move throughout the game, you will see that each enemy has its own unique type of fighting, keeping you on your toes and making you change up your fighting strategy.

In conclusion, I’m ecstatic to play this game. And, as a Twitch gamer, keep an eye out for my live streams the second this game is released (well, maybe not the second it’s released, but you get the idea). With the incredibly detailed graphics, terrifying yet sexy vampires (check out the trailer to see how insanely realistic Capcom made Lady Dimitrescu!), and other awesome updates, this Resident Evil game is looking to be insane.
