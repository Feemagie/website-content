After the release of No Man's Sky, the developers at **Hello Games** took on a new project created in an enchanting world that takes place between optimism and hopelessness called The Last Campfire. Developed by Hello Games' Chris Symonds and Steven Burgess, who both previously worked on the Wii game LostWinds, among others. The Last Campfire is very similar to No Man's Sky in that it's about the search for something bigger, a goal; only this time you're not in a spaceship, but in a colorful beyond-life world. 

### Glowing embers on a puzzle journey

You almost feel like you're diving into a storybook - **The Last Campfire** is about a mysterious pilgrimage "to a place where the lost embers go when their light slowly fades," is how the fairy-like narrator's voice describes the premise. It is a small, incredibly uplifting game of grand gestures, beautiful puzzles in a relaxed melancholic atmosphere and a captivating world.

For all gamers wondering what to expect with "The Last Campfire",  I went on a journey and searched for the last spark of hope for you - You can watch part of my gameplay... which I will provide as soon as I uploaded it. It shows plenty of scenes from the adventure, including some of the tricky puzzles that I personally took _embarrassingly_ longer solving than I should have.

### A last glimmer of hope - The Story / Gameplay

**The Last Campfire** begins the story where you, the player, is lost and held captive in a mysterious place; searching for meaning and a way home. You embody one of the lost creatures, or souls, called an Ember (already the game has you emotionally hooked somehow). You want to escort this cute sock-looking creature to the destination of their fateful journey at all cost. Your driving force are the sad remains of other Forlorn (Forlorns were also once Embers) that have lost all hope and now lie gray and lifeless upon the landscape. Your Ember remains silent throughout the game _(I personally liked this kind of narration. It adds a certain mystery to the already deep gameplay)_.

As you approach lost Forlorns in the game world, you'll first learn a little about them through the unique voice of the narrator, [Rachel August](https://twitter.com/rachelaugustuk). This creates some audiobook flair. That together with the cleverly used aesthetics and the cute art design immediately creates an immersive fantasy mood.

Next, you'll be magically transported (with an elegant transition) into an area with a puzzle to solve. I believe the puzzle symbolizes what the Forlorn feels. Here you clear short series of challenges by activating switches, turning levers, moving boxes, completing memory games, or figuring out the positioning of mechanical snake bodies (sounds more odd than it is)! Even though one would unlikely get stuck attempting the puzzles, every little win of progression felt very satisfying to me.

At the end of the puzzle level, you're awarded with a flame of sorts... A flame representing the frozen Forlorn's hope. With its hope restored then comes back to life and he/she joins you at a central campfire where saved souls gather. It also gets more in-depth and challenging here and there, especially towards the end, I was pondering quite a bit with the puzzlesâ€¦...it was very entertaining for my viewers on Stream though. As far as adventure games of this type go, it's as straightforward as it gets. With each puzzle you feel like you've made a little progress again, unlocking shortcuts to other areas and gradually learning more and more about the strange, sad mythology of a world you're gradually restoring hope to. But even away from the puzzle rooms, there's plenty to discover, figure out,  jump over water lilies, and a bunch of heartwarming encounters.

### Fairy tale flair for young and old

The Last Campfire attracts with its beautiful Graphics! A nicely stylized fantasy world that looks adequately old and mysterious - a clean layout that invites you to complete each and every puzzle of the clearly structured areas in between. The different environments are super well-done and invite you to linger every now and then. What I personally found remarkable and good is the multitude of lighting sources in the game scenes. The details is what got me hooked, the falling of the leaves and dust all around. The sticky spiderwebs you could run through, the colorful atmosphere, the natural presentation of nature, while giving it a daydream effect. The creativity of the realistic yet fantasy like Animals added in the game *no spoilers*! There is so much to mention, I hope you take a look for yourself! The game also runs smoothly at all times, which I would like to give the title a lot of credit for.

The Last Campfire also has one very Important positive aspect: the audiovisual presentation. The worlds are nicely stylized and the way the various characters are portrayed, such as the realistic yet fantasy like Animals, gives them a certain basic sympathy. The background music has also been chosen to match the rest of the title. There are a multitude of sound effects. The water splashes, a bird chirps - it can be as simple as that! Of course, this hardly distracts you while puzzling, the whole thing is very relaxing and pleasant. The Music is not particularly obtrusive, blends into the mysterious world with its puzzles with a certain charm and underlines the many emotional moments in the right places.

Unfortunately, The Last Campfire does have one catch. As beautifully elaborated the story is, the game has been technically implemented poorly by Hello Games. I had to restart the game twice, because glitches caused me to be suddenly trapped within a Bridge, and land area. One glitch happened during gameplay, where I floated through walls/ earth. Luckily it did not get me stuck - It was a funny hiccup on Stream (maybe link to Instagram post of the video here?) It's a pity that Hello Games didn't improve this a bit before release, but I hope they get to this bug in an update. Nevertheless, I don't want to end the review with a negative point, after all the game - apart from the technical point of view - is definitely recommendable. 

### Conclusion - Comfortable, profound puzzling

It's not witchcraft what Hello Games' smallest team has put together here, but it's a trip that's equal parts familiar (the puzzles) and yet uniquely alien (the world), which keeps pushing forward with proven means and motivating structure. There is a great lightness in The Last Campfire, despite the bittersweet subject matter, that you are happy to be carried away by. If you want to put your grey cells to work, The Last Campfire is made for you. It works both for a longer gaming session, but also just as well in small doses. The protagonists in the game, the Forlorn, are well written and bring human problems into the game without being overwhelming with them. Not only the visuals, but also the general presentation of the title and its characters, along with the calming flair, make the game special. The end will give you feels, trust me!
