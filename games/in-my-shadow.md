**[In My Shadow](https://www.inmyshadow.com/)** is an imaginative puzzle platformer developed by [Playbae](https://www.playbae.in/) that gradually illuminates a shrouded story about a woman through memories of her childhood. These memories manifest as a four-room playhouse the player must venture into as a shadow of her past self. With the use of other objects in the playhouse, the player can cast shadows to use as platforms. The arrangement of these objects is key to collecting her additional memories. The game offers a fun and soothing experience for players of all kinds.
