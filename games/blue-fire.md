**Blue Fire** is a single player action adventure game developed by [ROBI Studios](https://www.robistudios.com/). The game composes itself with an adventurous story through a mostly inhospitable environment called Penumbra. It is filled with many difficult arcade-like platform challenges that will test one's dexterity. Along with the acrobatic displays of movement and combat, the three-dimensional world offers many quests, secrets, and collectables. The learning curve can be high for newer players, but makes mastering the game mechanics rewarding to play and impressive to watch.
