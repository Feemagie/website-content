# Streamer Name - Feemagie

## Journey to Coming Up with my Steamer Username

Hello! I'm Feemagie. It wasn't easy coming up with a meaningful and/or easy to remember name to use as my online handle. It takes time, research, and having that special ring to it. Sometimes it's also desirable to be easily identified on a variety of different platforms. And for my case, keeping a consistent username between them is quite important. If you're trying to come up with that username for your own online presence, I hope this article of my own journey can be helpful in discovering what yours might be as well.

### Something Meaningful

I believe the first step to coming up with an online alias is to pick words that are meaningful personally, hobbies I like, or even the style I enjoy. An important note in regards to personally meaningful though: it does *not* mean personally identifiable. I don't at all recommend you include your birthday or mother's maiden name in your online alias. Especially as a streamer, I think it's important to keep your online presence disconnected from anything identifiable. Although, something less specific but connected to it would still be reasonable; like incorporating "Autumn" if you were born in the season, or maybe something related to the definition of your mother's maiden name. In any case, ensure what you pick also keeps you safe online.

I came up with my name by writing down a three words that had some connection to my name: the country I'm from, and the style I've adopted. And those words were Fairy, German, and Enchanting. From there, I developed a web of connecting words and definitions.

By the end, I had a plethora of words at my disposal. A very small portion of examples being:

* Sprite
* Elf
* Fee (German for fairy)
* Chante (Anagram of enchant, minus a single 'n')
* Magie (German for magic)
* Magical

In summary, I tried to come up with two or three words that sparked to me, and create a network of related meanings and things. With this I could easily find new words that spoke to me better!

### Something Available

Availability is an essential aspect to selecting my name. It definitely goes without saying... if I couldn't use it on the social platforms I was active on, I wouldn't be able to associate myself with it.

This is where writing down all those all those words and meanings paid off. I had plenty of words to shuffle, translate, and puzzle with. From here, I wanted to find out what names where available on the platforms I wanted to be present on. It was a bit difficult since there were so many: Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Discord, Instagram, Steam, Itch.IO... and a few more. I focused on the one's that were most important to me: Twitch, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and (although not a social platform) an available domain above all.

This narrowed my ideas down by quite a bit since, of course, these were very popular platforms with a phenomenal number of users with a vast variety registered names (some not even used). I think I was fortunate that combinations of German words were still available.

### Something to Remember

Memorability was another quality a name needed to have.

As I continued to narrow down my username, I also wanted to consider how memorable to would be. I didn't want it to be too long, complex, or compose of special characters uncommon in the English language. Anything that was longer than three syllables was crossed off the list.
