Indie games have been gaining popularity for several years. Well-known representatives are Super Meat Boy, Minecraft, Firewatch, Bastion, Limbo, Cuphead, and one of my all time favourites, Ori and the Blind Forest along with its sequel Ori and the Will of the Wisps. I'm sure many of you have heard the term, but what exactly categorizes something as an Indie Game? Is it a genre? What makes it special? At what point can titles like Minecraft no longer label themselves indie? How independent or how small does a development team need to be?

Join me as I explore and explain some of the definitions that currently exist and attempt to cut through the ambiguity of the term.

### Indie Games: New Flowing Winds to Genres

The origin of the word Indie might go without saying: it is an abbreviation for the word _independent_. This is not, per se, a genre, but a paradigm of producing and publishing (in this case games). However, there is some common qualitative theme that could be used to categorized them into a genre. That is, they are generally wildly innovative and unique; deviating from the traditional "proven" game designs concepts that most large development companies like to squeeze their cheeks on. At the same time, indie games aren't all different from Triple-A giants as they can also follow tradition. Indie is actually quite broad in regards to the types of games produced. Indeed, not something that can't be categorized easily in this aspect.

Furthermore, these games are projects realized by individuals or a comparatively small team of developers without much budget for resources or support from publishers. I believe most people see an indie team of no more than eight developers. However, many larger teams of 60 or more still label their games as indie.

In terms of distribution, most indie games tend to be sold as a digital copy via the Steam or Nintendo platform, for example, and not in stores. Maybe due to financial limitation and lack of knowledge in the business. However, there honestly isn't a need to physically distribute a game in current times. It works just as well to sell digitally now, thankfully. There are certainly exceptions - such as Nintendo's ["Nindies"](https://www.nintendo.com/games/nindies-hits/) or Bastion, which was supported by publisher Warner Bros. Interactive in distribution but not in development.

Overall, the historical and classic image of an indie developer is still that of a small (maybe one to eight members), ambitious team with limited financial resources and big visions. In the meantime the "indie scene" has become more professionalized and also produces larger projects that at first glance can hardly be distinguished from large blockbuster productions from the AAA sector. On the one hand, publishers are marketing more and more small indie productions. And on the other hand, well-known indies (or well-hyped) can have quite large budgets through crowdfunding to achieve financial successes - platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

### Transitions from Indie to Large Company are often Fluid

As stated, an indie developer team is very limited - in time, human resource, and with budget; **however**, they are more flexible, self-guided in their development, and more open to new and experimental ideas. Sometimes these ideas really hit well in the market or are hyped enough to catch the eye of some large publishers. This essentially begins the metamorphosis for the small indie team to cocoon itself into the beautiful butterfly known as a hierarchical business.

One of the most famous indie games, is Minecraft. Totally popular and successful nowadays and it used to be an indie game. Of course that's no longer the case. A lot has changed and spun from it over the 10 years of it's initial release. For one, Minecraft is not particularly sophisticated in the graphical department. It looks like a simplified digital Lego and has basically not been changed for years. Minecraft CEO Chiang believes that's precisely the advantage of the game's perennial hit: "We see that it's a game that players love to come back to again and again." The sole developer was the Swede Markus Persson, better known as "Notch." From the beginning, Minecraft thrilled the masses. Even after Microsoft bought the game and Persson's development company in 2014, the success did not diminish. The purchase of the game caused astonishment internationally, both in terms of the reason and the amount. After all, the software manufacturer from Redmond transferred 2.5 billion US dollars to the Swedish developer.

### The Indie Style

Certainly, some of the published indie games are purely casual games, but there are also more complex games with sometimes _very unusual, contemporary_ ideas. Apposed to providing established brands over and over again with a new part of their series. Some prominent representatives are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.

Indie Games are therefore not characterized by a high budget, but by the fact that they have a unique graphic style, stand out due to inventive gameplay elements and experiment more within their framework. They need unique selling points to succeed in the market, indie games often break with known principles. New ways of thinking about game mechanics, storytelling, and design forms are then in turn picked up by other indies or larger productions. In this way, indies question the familiar and advance the medium of "games" as a whole. Nevertheless, _not every indie game is an equal success_, because the new game mechanics or story ideas are of course _always received differently_.

#### The Charm of indies and The passion of the developers

Since it's damn difficult to develop a good indie game and the developers often stand alone, they put all their heart and soul into the game. Plus, the game ideas are often their own, which strengthens the developer's bond with their game. For indie developers, it's often more than just a job or a project they're working on. That's why they are able to get the best out of their game and create the games that indie fans love so much.

For my streams I will focus on Indie games defined mainly by the developers being Indie and not focusing on their publishers all that much. So what are Indie games? Well I think _the better question is **what aren't Indie games?**_
