## The Comfortable Beginner Setup for an Online Presence

You want to get into streaming. Maybe you want to be like the big Twitch streamers and YouTubers. Maybe you just want to share a passion with others. Maybe you just like talking with other people as you play. In any case, everyone started small (I mean, we were all small babies at some point). As long as you have a passion to share with the world, I can help cover the equipment and process needed to setup a high quality stream for your viewers.

Getting everything you need at once can be quite overwhelming, but no fear > Feemagie is here > you are not alone ~~... and never will be &#42; **creepy** &#42;~~ I've gone through the testing and buying of various hardware so you don't have to. Below is the list of computing and peripheral equipment that got me started that link to a more details: 

- [Above Average **PC**](#pc)
- [Balanced Quality **Monitor**](#monitor)
- [Quality **Microphone** for Vocals](#microphone)
- [Crisp **Webcam**](#webcam)
- [**Studio** Setup](#studio)
- [Additional **Peripherals**](#peripheral)

<h3 id="pc">Above Average PC</h3>

How "above average" your PC needs to be for streaming on Twitch and/or YouTube is difficult to generalize. It depends a lot on your content. First of all, you have to consider that your PC needs additional processing power to encode the video content for transmission out to the world. Furthermore, you need to consider an increase in processing power if you plan to run your game on the same PC. It would be subject to two jobs at once, so to speak.

Also, if you're like me, and normally playing less performance-intensive content (such as a pixel games), it requires much less power from the PC. Same goes with playing from another console with a capture card. Still, you can't ever go wrong with the most power you can get. A high-end PC with the latest released graphics card and a powerhouse CPU (at least i7 or higher) with something around 3 to 4 GHz per core and sufficient memory (8 GB upwards) is pretty well suited. A desktop PC can be easily upgraded as needed over time and usually offers much more performance for the cost compared to a laptop.

<h3 id="monitor">Balanced Quality Monitor</h3>

What monitor do I need? Of course, you can get started with a simple and inexpensive monitor. Later in time you'll want to get a monitor that can display the picture extremely fast, clear and without annoying picture / lag errors.

<h3 id="microphone">Quality Microphone for Vocals</h3>

_What do I need for a USB audio interface for streaming?_ For the first step, a USB microphone may be sufficient to get started. Over time you will realize its limitations and will most likely want a professional XLR microphone as well as a professional mixing console that allows you to adjust the volume up and down via hardware controls and to feed in additional audio tracks.

<h3 id="webcam">Crisp Webcam</h3>

The Webcam along with a background will connect your viewers more to you. It makes a much more professional impression if you have an even background, rather than your average room in the back. If you wanna be really cool and yourself floating in front of your game, you'll wanna use a green screen (most common) to make the background transparent via the streaming software. A corresponding filter (Chroma Key or Color Key) detects certain color values, selects all nearby color values in each video frame and then makes them transparent. However, in the future, you might not even need a green screen as software gets more advanced.

You probably have your own phone already. Use that! Android or iPhone.
On the iPhone, the application to download is [EpocCam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epoccam-webcam-for-mac-and-pc/id449133483).
For Android, it's called [DroidCam](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev47apps.droidcam&hl=en&gl=US).

The brightness intensity is adjustable, there are 360 adjustable tone and all the lighting effects (flashes and so). You can get really creative with these! And if you just want some simple light, these will brighten you up perfectly =)"

        just purchase a green screen to pin up on your wall. Keep an eye out for technical advances in video processing though! You may not even need a green
        screen to remove your background."

Peripherals are the equipment connected to your PC (usually by USB) that provide interfacing, storage, or any other kind of external feature. You'll need these to if you're starting from ground zero or just want separate fresh assets for your streaming.
